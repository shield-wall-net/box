## Setup

Designed to run on:
* [Debian 12 netinstall](https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/)
* no Desktop environment (*GUI*)
* installed without `standard system utilities`

You may want to use LVM and use partitioning like this:

```bash
/sda
- /sda1 => ext4 /boot (512 MB)
- /sda2 => LVM

vg0
- lv1 => ext4 / (min 5 GB)
- lv2 => ext4 /var (min 5 GB)
- lv3 => swap (min 1 GB)
```

Run the setup-script:

```bash
apt install wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shield-wall-net/box/latest/scripts/setup.sh
bash setup.sh
# reboot
```
